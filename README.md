# Title: Technology might be making education worse
# Author: ANTERO GARCIA
# Publication: Standford Report 

I found this article interesting because, as a student studying computer science, I want to get into tech through the route of figuring out how we can use technology to make books and education more accessible. With that being said, I want to figure out how technology can be a tool to aid a stronger education system rather than taking it over. Garcia talks about this exactly in that technology platforms have taken over school systems (especially with the pandemic). 

Rather than support their education, technology has "reshaped students' bodies and their relation to the world around them". The education systems have been built around technology, rather than the other way around (technology should be build around education). Garcia states, 'But my ongoing exploration of how platforms reduce students to quantifiable data suggests that we are removing the innovation and imagination of students and teachers in the process'. I believe technology can be used to as a tool to help students learn more and be exposed more to the world, but it should not be the center of education. I think it's interesting that this is one of few articles talking about this because it is such a crucial topic that will determine the future of education.
