### Title: Technology might be making education worse
### Author: ANTERO GARCIA
### Publication: Standford Report 

I found this article interesting because, as a student studying computer science, I want to get into tech through the route of figuring out how we can use technology to make books and education more accessible. With that being said, I want to figure out how technology can be a tool to aid a stronger education system rather than taking it over. Garcia talks about this exactly in that technology platforms have taken over school systems (especially with the pandemic). 

Rather than support their education, technology has "reshaped students' bodies and their relation to the world around them". The education systems have been built around technology, rather than the other way around (technology should be build around education). Garcia states, 'But my ongoing exploration of how platforms reduce students to quantifiable data suggests that we are removing the innovation and imagination of students and teachers in the process'. I believe technology can be used to as a tool to help students learn more and be exposed more to the world, but it should not be the center of education. I think it's interesting that this is one of few articles talking about this because it is such a crucial topic that will determine the future of education.

## Comment by Kim

I agree with Garcia's arguments but not with his premise. Based on the article, I would say that Garcia's arguments more support the conclusion "technology 
might be making kids' lives worse" rather than "technology might be making education worse". I was expecting him to explain how technology might be worsening 
childrens's in-school behavior, performance, and academics. Instead, he explained how students essentially have their every moment recored both in and out 
of school turned into a data point for the use of companies but no real explanation of the educational consequences of this. I do agree, however, that this normalization of surveillance especially among a generation of children, is highly problematic. There has been legislation to have companies cease collecting data on minors but it seems it's too late. By having a generation grow up being used to having no privacy and being reduced to data for the benefit and profit of corporations, it makes them more prone to being docile to this type of dehumanizing treatment. They are less lilkey to rebel, as being constantly surveilled and having their personal data extratced from birth is all they know. This gives corporations more power and influence over them and future generations to come. 
And knowing that not every company has good intentions, yikes.,....
